Some of the new prostheses might need monthly repairs. Other might need repairs as little as once per year.\r\n\r\n###**Length of time between charging prosthesis**\r\nThe prosthesis will use a battery, which will need to be recharged routinely. You may have more than one battery so you can charge one while using another. For some prostheses, you may be able to go a full day before a recharge is necessary. For some, you may have to recharge the battery every 4 hours.\r\n\r\n###**Prosthesis weight**\r\nSome prostheses might weigh less than your arm would weigh. Others might weigh the same as your arm would weigh or more than your arm would weigh.\r\n\r\n###**Prosthesis socket**\r\nThe new prostheses may be attached to your body in different ways:\r\n* Some may use a typical socket or harness. \r\n* Some may use a more advanced harness. This harness would distribute the weight of the prosthesis around your arm, shoulder, and back. \r\n* Some may be attached using “osseous integration.” The prosthesis would attach to a post that is anchored in your bone. You may have better function, it may be easier to put the prosthesis on, and you may feel that the prosthesis attachment is more secure. You may have less pain and skin irritation. However, there is a risk of infection, the post loosening, and bending or breaking the post or the bone.\r\n\r\n###**Prosthesis gripping and lifting strength**\r\nSome new prostheses may only be able to grip and lift light objects that weigh about 5 pounds. Other new prostheses may be able to lift heavy objects that weigh 50 or 100 pounds.\r\n\r\n###**Compatibility with terminal devices**\r\nThe terminal device on a prosthesis is the part that is used like a hand. Some of the new prostheses may only have one option for the terminal device. Other new prostheses may let you change between more than one terminal device. For example, you may have access to different types of hands and grippers.\r\n\r\n###**Ease of donning and doffing**\r\nHow easy it is for you to put on and remove the prosthesis. Some new prostheses may take only a few seconds to put on. Others may take as much as a few minutes to put on.\r\n\r\n###**Noise during use**\r\nHow much noise the prosthesis makes while you’re using it. Some new prostheses may be as a whisper. Other new prostheses may be as loud as a normal conversation while you’re using them.\r\n\r\n###**Resistance to environmental exposure**\r\nWhether the prosthesis will break down in different conditions. Some new prostheses will:\r\n* Be able to get wet\r\n* Work well even in a dry climate\r\n* Work well even when dirt gets on them\r\n* Continue to work even when they are hit repeatedly or used to pound on something repeatedly\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
