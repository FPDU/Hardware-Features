Others might weigh the same as your arm would weigh or more than your arm would weigh.\r\n\r\n###**Recalibration frequency**\r\nYou may need to run a program so the prosthesis understands your intended movements. You may also need to run a program so the prosthesis gives you the correct sense of touch. Some new prostheses may need to be recalibrated once per day or less. Other new prostheses may need to be recalibrated twice per day or more.\r\n\r\n###**Noise during use**\r\nHow much noise the prosthesis makes while you’re using it. Some new prostheses may be as loud as a whisper. Other new prostheses may be as loud as a normal conversation while you’re using them.\r\n\r\n###**Speed, once movement has started**\r\nHow fast the prosthesis will move. With some new prostheses, you may be able to move as quickly as with an intact hand. For other new prostheses, you will move more slowly. It may take as long as 10 times the time it takes to do something with an intact hand.\r\n\r\n###**Length of time between charging prosthesis**\r\nThe prosthesis will use a battery, which will need to be recharged routinely. You may have more than one battery so you can charge one while using another. For some prostheses, you may be able to go a full day before a recharge is necessary. For some, you may have to recharge the battery every 4 hours.\r\n\r\n###**How often replacements or repairs are required**\r\nYou might need to send your prosthesis back to the manufacturer for repairs. Some of the new prostheses might need monthly repairs. Others might need repairs as little as once per year.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
