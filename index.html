<h3>
<a id="prosthesis-weight" class="anchor" href="#prosthesis-weight" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><strong>Prosthesis weight</strong>
</h3>

<p>Some prostheses might weigh less than your arm would weigh. Others might weigh the same as your arm would weigh or more than your arm would weigh.</p>

<h3>
<a id="recalibration-frequency" class="anchor" href="#recalibration-frequency" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><strong>Recalibration frequency</strong>
</h3>

<p>You may need to run a program so the prosthesis understands your intended movements. You may also need to run a program so the prosthesis gives you the correct sense of touch. Some new prostheses may need to be recalibrated once per day or less. Other new prostheses may need to be recalibrated twice per day or more.</p>

<h3>
<a id="noise-during-use" class="anchor" href="#noise-during-use" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><strong>Noise during use</strong>
</h3>

<p>How much noise the prosthesis makes while you’re using it. Some new prostheses may be as loud as a whisper. Other new prostheses may be as loud as a normal conversation while you’re using them.</p>

<h3>
<a id="speed-once-movement-has-started" class="anchor" href="#speed-once-movement-has-started" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><strong>Speed, once movement has started</strong>
</h3>

<p>How fast the prosthesis will move. With some new prostheses, you may be able to move as quickly as with an intact hand. For other new prostheses, you will move more slowly. It may take as long as 10 times the time it takes to do something with an intact hand.</p>

<h3>
<a id="length-of-time-between-charging-prosthesis" class="anchor" href="#length-of-time-between-charging-prosthesis" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><strong>Length of time between charging prosthesis</strong>
</h3>

<p>The prosthesis will use a battery, which will need to be recharged routinely. You may have more than one battery so you can charge one while using another. For some prostheses, you may be able to go a full day before a recharge is necessary. For some, you may have to recharge the battery every 4 hours.</p>

<h3>
<a id="how-often-replacements-or-repairs-are-required" class="anchor" href="#how-often-replacements-or-repairs-are-required" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><strong>How often replacements or repairs are required</strong>
</h3>

<p>You might need to send your prosthesis back to the manufacturer for repairs. Some of the new prostheses might need monthly repairs. Others might need repairs as little as once per year.</p>
